The assignement is designed to be an _asynchronous online workshop_ which can take an unlimited number of participants all working individaully and asynchronous to begin with - and then as they progress, they meet up in a common  :warning: _public_ ⚠️ [online dicussion forum](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) hosted by the template repo itself. Where I hope you will share your feedback, join the discussions either on features or on perspectives how instructers may utilise these features as a didactic tool in class. 

In the dicussions I have already made some bold and oppionated statements, so you can just jump right in, and share your own oppinion.

Note that this is [different from creating a fork or a clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates).




There's a workflow that starts whne you generate your repository - it copies the template issues over to your own repo - It may take 15-20 seconds to finish - You can monitor it in the __Actions__ tab.
