This repo is _both_ an assignement designed to be an _asynchronous online workshop_ which can take an unlimited number of participants all working individaully and asynchronous in a guided tour to the cornucopia of social coding features in GitHub. And it is _also_ a PLC - Professional Learning Community. Encouraging everyone with interest in the topic to join the [online dicussion forum](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) (:warning: _it's public_) hosted by the template repo itself using GitHub Dicussions features. My hope is that you will share your feedback, join the discussions and reflect on the perspectives on how professinoal instructers may utilise these features as a didactic tool in facilitating learning. 

In the dicussions I have already made some bold and oppionated statements, so you can just jump right in, and share your own oppinion.

### The learning assignemnt will touch (lightly) on the following features:

- MarkDown - including
  - Real Simple MarkDown
  - GitHub Flavored MarkDown
  - Advanced MarkDown
  - Mermaid diagrams
  - GitHub pages (Jekyll based Static websites)
- GitHub Issues - including:
  - Labels
  - Milestones
  - Projects
  - Pull Requests
- GitHub Actions - including
  - CI flow
  - CD flow 
- GitHub CodeSpaces - including: 
  - GitHub Copilot (extension)
  - GitKraken GitLens (extension)
  - Using the bash terminal
  - `.devcontainer` configuration file
  - `.gitconfig` configuration file - implemented as a repository level ðŸ†•, team shared config
  - `gh` the offical GitHub Command Line Interface 
- Community standards such as:
  - `README.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CODEOWNERS`
- GitHub Classrooms including
  - autograding
- Notifications - including
    - Notifier for GitHub (Google Chrome extension)

I've been using these features over the course of a semester to facilitate two classes of Computer Scientists (AP degree, 2<sup>nd</sup> semester) the topic of [_Technology_](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/3050241/2022-2023) and one class of IT Architects (B.Sc, 2<sup>nd</sup> semester) the topic of [_Agile Development_](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/4111203/2022-2023). In the process I've changed my mind, experimented, automated, pulled-back, burned my fingers, failed and succeded. I have seen smoke coming out of the students ears trying to wrickle their mind around the complexity of it all - and I've seen them glow - and grow - when they suddenly, after a few moments of disbelief and staring with empty eyes into the screen suddenly smile and mumble; _"Wow, this is sooooo cool!"_

In this assignment to my fellow instructors I'll also introduce some of the solutions that I felt I needed and chose to develop on top of all the standardized features. One of them is to enable the individual assignemnts to be presented to them through the built-in GitHub Issues (creating a repo off a template, doesn't support copy of issues - I built that feature into a github action flow).

I said earlier that I will only touch lightly on the topics - actually I might here and there limit it to just mention features and throw some pointers to where you can dive deeper yourself. This is deliberate, to enable everyone, regarding their level of interest, to be able to join the discussions as soon as possible. You can spend 30 minutes on this - or the entire summer holiday. There's always another layer underneath.

Some of you - I hope - may be inspired and want to learn even more details about certain topics or features than I introduce here. In that case I send you straight to [the dicussions ðŸ“£](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions), where we can pick up any nitty gritty detail you want to explore. Feel free to mention me [@lakruzz](https://github.com/lakruzz) to get my attention.

### Code of Conduct
#### This repo (this template) is open source 
If you join [the dicussion](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) on this repo then your postings will be _unmoderated_ and _publicly available_ to the entire world. It's in no way different than what you are used to on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Stackoverflow. But I just wanted to give you a heads up! Be your usual public self: Engaged and polite.

#### GDPR does not apply
Since you are here 100% voulenteerly and you are using a GitHub account which you created and control yourself. The - despite that you may well have a professional interest in participating - you are nevertheless here as a private person at your own will. GDPR does not apply, no one signed a _data processing agreement_. So be your usual public self: Engaged and polite.

### Enough!
Let's get started:

This repo is a template. You create yourself a copy of it by using this repo as a template:

#### Get your own copy

[**_Code_ >> _Use this template_ >> _Create new repository_**](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/generate)

<a href="https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/generate"><img width="198" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155492/228839581-5ca9dddd-a39f-4754-811c-92f092517734.png"></a>

Note that this is [different from creating a fork or a clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates).

#### Work those issues
There's a automated GitHub Actions workflow that starts immidately when you generate your repository - it copies the template issues over to your own repo - It may take 15-20 seconds to finish - You can monitor it in the __Actions__ tab - of your own newly created repo, not this particular template.

Continue there - and then join the rest of us in [the discussions](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) when you're ready.

### If you need help. 
- There's always our [the discussions](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) - where you can mention me ([@lakruzz](https://github.com/lakruzz))
- Or you can mention me ([@lakruzz](https://github.com/lakruzz)) or assign me to issues in your own repo (If you've granted me access).
