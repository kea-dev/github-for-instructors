# GitHub For Instructors

__This repo is a a template for a learning assignment, designed specifically for instructors who teach elements of programming and want to utilize git and GitHub features in their offering towards learners.__

<img width="100" align="left" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155492/219313640-1328aefb-7695-41d2-bbef-5c5ffe6ab079.png">

The assignement is designed to be an _asynchronous online workshop_ which can take an unlimited number of participants all working individaully and asynchronous to begin with - and then as they progress, they meet up in a common _public_ :warning: [online dicussion forum](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) hosted by the template repo itself. My hope is that you will share your feedback, join the discussions either on features or on perspectives to how instructers may utilise these features as a didactic tool in facilitating learning. 

In the dicussions I have already made some bold and oppionated statements, so you can just jump right in, and share your own oppinion.

### The learning assignemnt will touch (lightly) on the following features:

- MarkDown - including
  - Real Simple MarkDown
  - GitHub Flavored MarkDown
  - Advanced MarkDown
  - Mermaid diagrams
  - GitHub pages (Jekyll based Static websites)
- GitHub Issues - including:
  - Labels
  - Milestones
  - Projects  
- GitHub CodeSpaces - including: 
  - GitHub Copilot (extension)
  - GitKraken GitLens (extension)
  - Using the bash terminal
  - `.devcontainer` configuration file
  - `.gitconfig` configuration file - implemented as a repository level ðŸ†•, team shared config
  - GitHub Command Line Interface `gh`
- Community standards such as:
  - `README.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CODEOWNERS`
- GitHub Classrooms including
  - autograding

I've been using these features over the course of a semester to facilitate two classes of Computer Scientists (AP degree, 2<sup>nd</sup> semester) the topic of [_Technology_](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/3050241/2022-2023) and one class of IT Architects (B.Sc, 2<sup>nd</sup> semester) the topic of [_Agile Development_](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/4111203/2022-2023). In the process I've changed my mind, experimented, automated, pulled-back, burned my fingers, failed and succeded. I have seen smoke coming out of the students ears trying to wrickle their mind around the complexity of it all - and I've seen them glow - and grow - when they suddenly, after a few moments of disbelief and staring with empty eyes into the screen suddenly smile and mumble; _"Wow, this is sooooo cool!"_

In this assignment to my fellow instructors I'll also introduce some of the solutions that I personally chose do develop on top of all the standardized features. One of them is to enable the individual assignemnts to be presented to them through the built-in GitHub Issues.

I said earlier I will only touch lightly on the topics - actually I might here and there limit it to just throw some pointers to where you can dive deeper yourself. This is deliberate, to enable everyone, regarding their level of interest, to be able to join the discussions as soon as possible. You can spend 30 minutes on this - or the entire summe holiday. There's always another layer underneath.

Some of you, I hope, may be inspired and want to learn even more details than I give here, about certain topics or features. In that case I send you straight to [the dicussions ðŸ“£](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions), where we can pick up any nitty gritty detail you want to explore.

### Code of Conduct
#### This repo (this template) is open source 
If you create new [issues](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/issues/new) or comment on [existing issues](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/issues) or join [the dicussion](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/discussions) on this repo then your postings will be _unmoderated_ and _publicly available_ to the entire world. It's probably not really different than what you are used to on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Stackoverflow. But I just wanted to give you a heads up! Be your usual public self: Engaged and polite.

### GDPR does not apply
Since you are here 100% voulenteerly and you are using an account which you created and control yourself. Despite that you may well have a professional interest in participating, you are nevertheless here as a private person at your own will. Be your usual public self: Engaged and polite.

### Enough!
Let's get started:

This repo is a template. You create your a new repo, using this one as a te

[**_Code_ >> _Use this template_ >> _Create new repository_**](https://github.com/kea-dev/github-for-instructors/generate)

Note that this is [different from creating a fork or a clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates).




There's a workflow that starts whne you generate your repository - it copies the template issues over to your own repo - It may take 15-20 seconds to finish - You can monitor it in the __Actions__ tab.

## If you need help. 

1. You are welcome to come back to [the issues of this template repo](https://github.com/kea-dev/planetscale/issues) here and comment on some of the existing ones - or create new ones.  
2. You can also mention me ([@lakruzz](https://github.com/lakruzz)) or assign me to issues in your own repo. 
3. And of course there's always our [discussion on github/kea-dev](https://github.com/orgs/kea-dev/discussions)
